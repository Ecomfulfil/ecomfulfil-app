            <strong>CCTV Information</strong> – Closed circuit video
            surveillance cameras (“CCTV”) may be installed at some of

            estimated based on a browser or device&apos;s IP address).
            We may also use location-based technology in our retail
            locations, such as iBeacons, to collect information about
            the presence of your device, if your Bluetooth is turned
            on and your device settings allow for this.

            available, provided by or purchased from marketing
            business partners, or present on social media platforms.

            <strong>Web Beacons</strong> – Web beacons are small,
            transparent images that are embedded in web pages,
            applications, and emails that are sometimes called clear
            gifs, single pixel gifs, page tags or web bugs. We use web
            beacons to track the web pages you visit, to test the
            effectiveness of our marketing, and to find out if an
            email has been opened and acted on.

            <strong>Entity Tags</strong> - Entity Tags are HTTP code
            mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or
            cached within your browser and validates these caches when
            the website is opened, accelerating website performance

            if the content has not changed.

          <p>
            <strong>HTML5 Local Storage </strong>– HTML5 local storage
            allows data from websites to be stored or cached within

            websites and mobile applications. They show us how
            visitors and customers interact with our digital
            properties, whether there are any errors, the degree to
            which certain web pages, applications, services or

          <h2>18. Participation in the Privacy Shield Frameworks</h2>
          <p>
            On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice
            invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a
            transfer mechanism for data between EU and U.S. companies.
            On September 8, 2020, the Swiss supervisory authority
            similarly announced that it no longer considered the
            Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as adequate for
            personal data transfers from Switzerland to the U.S.,
            Ecomfulfil Franchising Corp. will utilize alternate
            appropriate safeguards going forward for such data
            transfers. Even though the Privacy Shield Frameworks have
            been invalidated, Ecomfulfil will continue to honor its
            commitments with respect to EU and Swiss personal data
            transfer pursuant to Privacy Shield prior to the
            respective Frameworks&apos; invalidation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ecomfulfil Franchising Corp. participates in and has
            certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S.
            Privacy Shield Frameworks. Ecomfulfil is committed to
            subjecting all personal data received from European Union
            (EU) member countries, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom
            in reliance on the Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the
            applicable Principles. To learn more about Privacy Shield,

            Ecomfulfil is responsible for the processing of personal
            data it receives, and subsequently transfers to a third
            party acting as an agent on its behalf, under the Privacy
            Shield Framework. Ecomfulfil complies with the Privacy
            Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal
            data from the EU, the U.K., and Switzerland, including the
            onward transfer liability provisions.

            With respect to personal data received or transferred
            pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Ecomfulfil is
            subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S.
            Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations,
            Ecomfulfil may be required to disclose personal data in
            response to lawful requests by public authorities,
            including to meet national security or law enforcement
