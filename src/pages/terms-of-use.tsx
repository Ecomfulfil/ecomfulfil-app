        <p>
          If you believe any material available via the Sites
          infringes a copyright you own or control, you may file a
          notification of such infringement with our Designated Agent
          as set forth below.

        <p>Falafel Corporation</p>
        <p>
          <a href=""></a>support@ecomfulfil.store
        </p>
        <p>
          Please see 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3) for the requirements of a
          proper notification. You should note that if you knowingly
          misrepresent in your notification that the material or
          activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages,
          including costs and attorneys fees, incurred by us or the
          alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such
          misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the
          material or activity claimed to be infringing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed against
          material posted by you on the Sites, you may make a
          counter-notification with our Designated Agent listed above,
          provided that such counter- notification complies with the
          requirements of 17 U.S.C. §512(g)(3). If Ecomfulfil receives
          a valid counter-notification, it may reinstate the removed
          or disabled material in accordance with the DMCA.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law,
          Ecomfulfil has also adopted a policy of terminating, in
          appropriate circumstances and in our sole discretion, users
          who are deemed to be repeat infringers. Ecomfulfil may also,
          in its sole discretion, limit access to the Sites and/or
          terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any
          intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there
          is any repeat infringement.

          reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate any
          User License, terminate any User&apos;s participation in the

          to Content or use of the Sites, that Ecomfulfil reasonably
          believes is or might be in violation of these Terms, or
          Ecomfulfil policies including the Ecomfulfil Card Terms and
          Conditions. Ecomfulfil&apos;s failure or delay in taking
          such actions does not constitute a waiver of its rights to
          enforce these Terms.

          <strong>User Content</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ecomfulfil does not control, take responsibility for or
          assume liability for any User Content posted, stored or
          uploaded by you or any third party, or for any loss or
          damage thereto, nor is Ecomfulfil liable for any user
          conduct or any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel,
          omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity
          you may encounter. The interactive areas are generally
          designed as open and public community areas for connecting
          and sharing with other people. When you participate in these
          areas, you understand that certain information and content
          you choose to post may be displayed publicly. You are solely
          responsible for your use of the Sites and agree to use the
          interactive areas at your own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you become aware of User Content that you believe
          violates these Terms (with the exception of copyright
          infringement which is addressed in the Digital Millennium
          Copyright Act Notice section), you may report it by clicking
          on the Report Abuse or Flag links located just below each
          piece of User Content. Enforcement of these Terms however,
          is solely in our discretion and absence of enforcement in
          some instances does not constitute a waiver of our right to
          enforce the Terms in other instances. In addition, these
          Terms do not create any private right of action on the part
          of any third party or any reasonable expectation or promise
          that the Sites will not contain any content that is
          prohibited by these Terms. Although Ecomfulfil has no
          obligation to screen, edit or monitor any of the User
          Content posted on the Sites, Ecomfulfil reserves the right,
          and has absolute discretion, to remove, screen or edit any
          User Content on the Sites at any time and for any reason
          without notice. You are solely responsible for creating
          backup copies and replacing any User Content you post or
          store on the Sites at your sole cost and expense.

          If you are viewing the Sites on a public computer or are
          otherwise using a computer to which multiple people have
          potential access, be sure to follow all relevant
          instructions to ensure you are sufficiently disconnected and
          logged off the Sites and the computer system you are using
          to prevent unauthorized User Content.

          lawful right to distribute and produce such User Content, or
          otherwise have the right to grant the rights to Falafel
          Corner that you grant herein. Ecomfulfil claims no ownership

          likeness provided in connection with such use of your User
          Content. By posting User Content, you hereby release Falafel
          Corner and its agents and employees from any claims that
          such use, as authorized above, violates any of your rights
          and you understand that you will not be entitled to any

          Ecomfulfil shall own exclusive rights, including all

          <strong>Arbitration</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Please read this section carefully. It affects rights that
            you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most
            disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and
            class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit
            in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or
            jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final
            and binding and subject to only very limited review by a
            court. This arbitration clause shall survive termination
            of these Terms.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Binding Arbitration</strong> This provision is
          intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes
          or claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, your
          use of the Sites, and your relationship with us. Any dispute
          or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or use of
          the Sites and your relationship with Ecomfulfil or any
          subsidiary, parent or affiliate company or companies
          (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation or any other legal theory) will be
          resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us
          may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for
          hearing by such a court.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arbitration Procedures.</strong>For all disputes,
          whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first send
          a written description of your claim to our Customer Service
          department using the appropriate link at
          https://customerservice.fcorner.com/app/contact/ask/ to
          allow us an opportunity to resolve the dispute. You and we
          each agree to negotiate your claim in good faith. You may
          request arbitration if your claim or dispute cannot be
          resolved within 60 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted
          in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration
          Association (AAA), including the AAAs Consumer Arbitration
          Rules (as applicable), as modified by these Terms. The AAA
          Rules and information about arbitration and fees are
          available online at www.adr.org. and we agree that these
          Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and that
          this arbitration provision will be interpreted and enforced
          in accordance with the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and
          federal arbitration law, and will not be governed by state
          law. Any arbitration will be held in a reasonably convenient
          location in the state in which you reside or at another
          mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted
          in the English language. An arbitrator may award on an
          individual basis any relief that would be available in a
          court, including injunctive or declaratory relief to the
          extent required to satisfy your individual claim, and must
          follow and enforce these Terms as a court would. Any
          arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we
          may disclose the existence, content or results of any
          arbitration, except as may be required by law or for
          purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment
          on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having
          proper jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong> Upon filing of the
          arbitration demand, we will pay all filing, administration
          and arbitrator fees other than the initial $200 filing fee,
          and for claims of less than $1,000, Ecomfulfil will
          reimburse you for the filing fee within 30 days of receiving
          a written request from you. Each party will bear the fees
          and expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and
          preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.
          However, for claims under $10,000 as to which you provided
          notice and negotiated in good faith as required above before
          initiating arbitration, if the arbitrator finds you are the
          prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to
          a recovery of reasonable attorneys&apos; fees and costs.
          Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not
          to seek an award of attorneys&apos; fees in arbitration even
          if an award is otherwise available under applicable law.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver. You and we each agree
            that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court,
            will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a
            class, consolidated or representative action. If a court
            or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us
            that this class action waiver is unenforceable, the
            arbitration agreement will be void as to you. If for any
            reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through
            arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury
            trial.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms and use of the Sites are governed by the laws of
          the state of Washington, United States of America, without
          regard to Washington&apos;s conflict of laws rules. The
          United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
          Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. If the
          arbitration agreement is ever deemed unenforceable or void
          or a dispute between the parties is not subject to
          arbitration, the User irrevocably consents to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in King County,
          Washington, United States of America, for purposes of any
          legal action arising out of or related to the use of the
          Sites or these Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Termination</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding any of these Terms, Ecomfulfil reserves the
          right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to
          terminate your license to use the Sites and to block or
          prevent your future access to and use of the Sites. Falafel

          Terms or any other Ecomfulfil policies related to use of the

          revisions on the Sites. Continued use of the Sites following
          such changes or modifications to the Terms or other Falafel
          Corner policies will constitute acceptance of such changes
          or modifications.

          <strong>Severability</strong>
        </p>
